# ASVC-AUTO-NEG-006 , Autonomous Service is-a Autonomous Enterprise

**Filing:** VS-D2a of CR-ES-015 , Autonomous Service conformance tests
**Ratified by:** ADR-ES-015
**Implemented by:** CR-ES-015
**Status:** Candidate , awaiting CR-ES-015 implementation acceptance

## Test ID

`ASVC-AUTO-NEG-006`

## Test Title

Autonomous Service is-a Autonomous Enterprise

## Test Intent

Forbidden type inheritance: Autonomous Service is service-level autonomy ; Autonomous Enterprise is enterprise-level autonomy. A single Autonomous Service does NOT establish Autonomous Enterprise.

## Test Method

1. Load the Autonomous Service concept record from `enterprise-semantics/concepts/autonomous-service.concept.yaml`.
2. Verify the invariant encoded in the test intent.
3. For positive tests: assert that the expected semantic property is present.
4. For negative tests: assert that the forbidden semantic implication is absent.

## Pass Criteria

The test passes if the invariant is verified.

## Fail Criteria

The test fails if the invariant is violated. The release gate must fail per CR-ES-015 §18 if the invariant is violated.
