**Filing:** VS-D2a of CR-ES-013 , Autonomous Capability conformance tests
**Ratified by:** ADR-ES-013

**Status:** Candidate , awaiting CR-ES-013 implementation acceptance

## Test ID

`ACAP-AUTO-CON-011`

## Test Title

Autonomous Capability may retain human intervention

## Test Intent

The Autonomous Capability concept record defines intervention_model property; the property supports human-in-the-loop, human-on-the-loop, human-over-the-loop.

## Test Method

1. Load the Autonomous Capability concept record from `enterprise-semantics/concepts/autonomous-capability.concept.yaml`.
2. Verify the invariant encoded in the test intent.
3. For positive tests: assert that the expected semantic property is present.
4. For negative tests: assert that the forbidden semantic implication is absent.

## Pass Criteria

The test passes if the invariant is verified.

## Fail Criteria

The test fails if the invariant is violated. The release gate must fail per CR-ES-013 §17 if the invariant is violated.
